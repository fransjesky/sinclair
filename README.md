Welcome to the repository of **Project Sinclair**. This is a repository for my portfolio website.

### What is Project Sinclair?

I have been a gamer almost my whole life. Every time i play games, i always use the name **Sinclair** as my nickname. That is why i chose the name Sinclair for this project's name.

In 2020, i created my first portfolio website. It was quite good, but i never finished it. I was thinking of continuing or revamping it a few times. However, as my skills improved from time to time, i decided it was better to just start over from scratch.

As being said, that is the story behind project sinclair. It is a project to create my new immersive and breathtaking personal portfolio website.

### Contribution

At first, i wanted to keep this project private. However, i changed my mind and decided to make it public. There are some reasons behind it:

I never think my code is clean and perfect. It would be great if other people could help me find any bugs, errors, or even give suggestions by opening an issue or a pull request.

Being able to be helpful or inspiring is one of the most wonderful feelings in life. That is why i decided to make this project public, hoping someone out there could be helped or inspired by it.
